# The Big Idea

This project is a work-in-progress working through The Design and Analysis of
Computer Algorithms by Aho, Hopcroft, & Ullman.

I thought it would be interesting to implement the various machine abstractions
in Python, and play around a little in building a Pidgin Algol
interpreter/compiler and translators between the abstractions. The focus is on
implementing and playing around with the abstractions and algorithms.
